# Bayesian Inference of the Antikythera Mechanism

This project applies Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to infer the number and arrangement of holes in the calendar ring of the Antikythera mechanismâ€”an ancient Greek astronomical calculator dated to ~100 BC. The aim is to understand whether the mechanism was based on a **solar (365-hole)** or **lunar (354-hole)** calendar by modeling X-ray data of surviving fragments.
---

## Summary

- Modeled the fractured calendar ring as a regular circular structure with sections allowed to rotate/translate independently
- Implemented two likelihood models:
  - Isotropic Gaussian error model
  - Radial/tangential anisotropic Gaussian error model
- Derived and implemented analytic gradients for the log-likelihood function
- Used HMC to sample the posterior distribution of key parameters (e.g. number of holes, ring radius, transformation parameters)
- Compared posterior predictions and model fits

## Data

- Public X-ray data and measured hole coordinates were provided by Thoeni et al. (see Reference [3])
- Data file include:
    - Measured hole posistions

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Data

- `data.csv` should be placed in the `data/` folder. It contains the coordinates of hole locations across different sections of the Antikythera calendar ring.

### 2. Install Required Packages

Make sure you're using **Python 3.10 or higher**. Then install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
